Cleanup:
    - [ ] Create design doc that lays out current design and desired outcome
    - [ ] Can we apply typestate pattern?
    - [ ] Swap error-chain for failure crate
    - [ ] Comb through crate for poor design patterns
    - [ ] use the Default trait
    - [ ] Investigate Error::clone(), why was non-exhaustive
    - [ ] Revisit: clippy::if_same_then_else
    - [x] Update dependencies
    - [x] consider replacing openssl lib with rustls or update to openssl 0.10
