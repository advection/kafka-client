Cleanup:
    - [ ] Swap error-chain for failure crate // zlb: in progress 
    - [ ] Comb through crate for poor design patterns
    - [ ] consider replacing openssl lib with rustls or update to openssl 0.10
    - [ ] use the Default trait // zlb: is this what is referenced in [producer](./src/producer.rs) around line 100?
    - [ ] Swap error-chain for failure crate
    - [ ] Setup CI, for unit & integration tests
    - [ ] Create design doc that lays out current design and desired outcome
    - [ ] Can we apply typestate pattern?
    - [ ] Investigate Error::clone(), why was non-exhaustive
    - [ ] Revisit: clippy::if_same_then_else
    - [x] Update dependencies
    - [x] consider replacing openssl lib with rustls or update to openssl 0.10
